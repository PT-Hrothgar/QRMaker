# QRMaker
Simple Flask app for generating QR codes.

This app is very simple to use: to generate a QR code for any URL, once you have gone to wherever it is hosted (maybe [turnerforever.com](http://turnerforever.com)?), all you have to do is clear the input element of the URL it already contains (https://example.com) and enter your own URL in. The QR code will automatically be generated, and displayed below with an option to download it as a PNG image.
